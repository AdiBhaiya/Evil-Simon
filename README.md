<p>
	Hey pros. This is my 1st web based game, called Evil Simon.
	As the name suggests, this Simon is Evil ðŸ‘¿ and speaks rudely ðŸ¤¬, like an Evil.
	The concept of this game is same as the original Simon Says game, but the Evil Simon has a bit of difficulty to offer, and you have to overcome that difficulty, by making and breaking high scores.
	The reason for it's difficulty that unlike the OG Simon Says game, where the entire series of nodes are blipped for each level, here only the new node will blip, and the player will have to remember the previous order.<br /><br />
</p>

<h2>Didn't Get It? Let Me Help :)</h2>
<p>
	Simon is evil, but I, the developer of this game, am not ðŸ‘¼<br/>
	I can help you against this Evil Simon. Read the below paragraph and you will know how to deal with this Evil Simon:
	<ul>
		<li>
			<b>Level 1: </b>Red button (ðŸ”´) blips. You click on Red(ðŸ”´) button to move to next level.<br />
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Level 2: </b>Blue button (ðŸ”µ) blips. You click on Red(ðŸ”´) -> Blue(ðŸ”µ) buttons to move to next level.<br />
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Level 3: </b>Green button (ðŸŸ¢) blips. You click on Red(ðŸ”´) -> Blue(ðŸ”µ) -> Green(ðŸŸ¢) buttons to move to next level.<br />
		</li>
	</ul>
	(and so on ...)
</p>
<p>
	In the OG Simon game, first Red button would blip and then Blue button (for level 2), and first Red button would blip. then Blue button, and lastly Red button again (for level 3).
	But here, only the Blue button blips for level 2, and only the Red button blips for level 3, and so on ...
	So, in order to achieve a high score, you need to have a sharp memory so that you can remember the previous order, and you don't get confused at any level :)<br /><br />
