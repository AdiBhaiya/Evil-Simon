<h1>EVIL SIMON</h1>

Hey pros. This is my 1st web based game, called Evil Simon.
This concept of the game is same as the original Simon Says game, but the level of difficulty is harder than the original game.
The reason for it's difficulty that unlike the OG Simon Says game, where the entire series of nodes are blipped for each level, here only the new node will blip, and the player will have to remember the previous order.<br /><br />
Didn't get it? Let me help.<br />
<b>Level 1: </b>Red blips. You click on Red button and move to next level.<br />
<b>Level 2: </b>Blue blips. You click on Red -> Blue buttons and move to next level.<br />
<b>Level 3: </b>Red blips again. You click on Red -> Blue -> Red buttons and move to next level.<br />
(and so on ...)<br /><br />
In the OG Simon game, first Red button would blip and then Blue button (for level 2), and first Red button would blip. then Blue button, and lastly Red button again (for level 3).
But here, only the Blue button blips for level 2, and only the Red button blips for level 3, and so on ...
So, in order to achieve a high score, you need to have a sharp memory so that you can remember the previous order, and you don't get confused at any level :)
